# SNHU_CS250_Sprint_Review_And_Retrospective


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  By meeting with users and stakeholders directly and frequenty, a product owner can develop accurate and concise user stories. User stories help to translate user needs to the team in a way that encompasses the end user's expectations but still allows the developer room to interpret and experiment with fulfilling those needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  The sprint process is integral to agile methodology. Breaking work into manageable pieces and reiterating through cycles of work allows developers and testers to ensure the quality of their work without getting overwhelmed by the scope of a large project. This mentality could be applied to any task in life really.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member is all about being transparent and focused while still remaining open to new ideas and approaches. If all memebers of a team are forthcoming, honest, responsible, dedicated, and productive, there is little that team could not accomplish. One should be able to trust others to do their job and should strive to be someone who can also be counted on to fullfill their role.
